## Technical Overview: KRIK Non-Profit Organization Website

### Project Description
The KRIK Non-Profit Organization Website is a comprehensive platform designed to showcase the organization's projects, events, and volunteer opportunities. It serves as a central hub for members, volunteers, and donors to connect, contribute, and engage with the organization's activities. The website features detailed information about ongoing and completed projects, a volunteer sign-up form, donation options, an e-shop for handmade jewelry (with proceeds supporting the organization), and accessibility options catering to users with specific needs.

### Development Approach & Technologies
The development of the KRIK website was guided by the principles of accessibility, responsiveness, and user-friendly design. Given the focus on desktop users initially, the website was built using a tech stack that supports scalability to other device types in the future.

### Technologies Used:
CSS: Styled the website, incorporating flexibility to adjust font sizes, contrast, and saturation for enhanced accessibility.

Bootstrap: Leveraged for its responsive design features and components, making the site adaptable to various screen sizes and devices, though the current focus is on desktop versions.

TypeScript: Added type safety to JavaScript code, improving the development process and reducing errors, which is crucial for maintaining the interactive elements of the site.

Next.js: Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, enhancing the website's performance and SEO. Next.js supports the creation of a dynamic, fast-loading website, which is essential for the diverse 
content and functionalities offered.

### Accessibility Features
Accessibility was a key consideration in the development of the KRIK website, with features including:

Font size adjustment: Allows users to increase or decrease the text size based on their preference.

High contrast mode: Enhances the visibility of text and interface elements for users with visual impairments.

Saturation control: Users can adjust the color saturation of the website for easier viewing.

Enlarged cursor: Facilitates easier navigation for users with motor impairments or difficulty in tracking smaller cursors.

Animation pause: Users sensitive to motion can pause animations to prevent discomfort.

Reading mask: Assists users with reading difficulties by focusing on specific sections of the text at a time.

### Current State and Future Plans
Currently, the KRIK website is optimized for desktop use, focusing on delivering a comprehensive and accessible experience to users primarily accessing the site via desktop computers. Future development plans include expanding the responsive design to fully embrace mobile and tablet devices, ensuring that the website's accessibility and user-friendly design are consistent across all platforms.

By utilizing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, TypeScript, and Next.js, the KRIK Non-Profit Organization Website stands as a testament to modern web development practices, emphasizing performance, accessibility, and user engagement.
